## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Codein Code of Conduct](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [production@codein.fr](mailto:production@codein.com).

## What should I know before I get started?

### Symfony

**Codein eZ Platform SEO Toolkit** is a symfony bundle. As such, we aim at providing code that comply to [symfony coding standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html).

### eZ Platform

This symfony bundle aims at providing tools for eZ Platform, a Digital Experience Platform (DXP) edited by Ibexa.

As such, we don't provide tools for a Symfony only application, and don't plan to.

### Design Decisions

When we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what we can or cannot support, we will document it in the [/docs](https://github.com/Codein-Labs/ezplatform-seo-toolkit/tree/master/docs) folder of the repository. If you have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is documented there. If it is *not* documented there, please open a new issue and ask your question.
